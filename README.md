# ts-webpack-starter
Starter project for a basic TypeScript application using webpack. 

## Getting Started ##

Step one is to get all the dependencies installed. This project requires
node and npm. Install those first, then run

    npm install

This project uses webpack with wepback-dev-server to build and serve your
static js files in dist where index.html is located. To start working run

    npm run dev

and go to `http://localhost:8080`. Once started, wepback will watch your
source files for changes and automatically rebuild and refresh the browser.
