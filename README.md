# ts-webpack-starter (deprecated--no longer maintained/used)
Starter project for a basic TypeScript application using webpack. 

## Getting Started ##

Step one is to get all the dependencies installed. This project requires
node and npm. Install those first, then run

    npm install

This project uses webpack with wepback-dev-server to build and serve your
static `js` files in `dist` where `index.html` is located. To start working,
run

    npm run dev

and go to <http://localhost:8080>. Once started, wepback will watch your
source files for changes and automatically rebuild and refresh the browser.
